## Project setup

You can find the files for the workshop on GitHub [https://github.com/wvegteren/workshop-nativescript/](https://github.com/wvegteren/workshop-nativescript/). 

The starter files for the workshop are in the `/exercise` folder. 

If you want to follow the workshop via Nativescript Playground you can skip this chapter and 
move to chapter 4 to get started.

For NativeScript Sidekick you need to clone the repo and navigate to its `/exercise` folder by running the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/wvegteren/workshop-nativescript.git
cd workshop-nativescript/exercise
```

Next, you can open the exercise folder in NativeScript sidekick. From NativeScript Sidekick 
you can open the project in a IDE of choice and run local builds or cloud build.

Note: for local builds you need to have the platform SDKs installed as mentioned on this page:
[https://docs.nativescript.org/sidekick/intro/installation](https://docs.nativescript.org/sidekick/intro/installation#step-4-optional-install-ios-and-android-requirements-for-local-builds).
