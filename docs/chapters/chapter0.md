## Introductions

Welcome! Below you’ll find all slides and instructions for the hands-on activities for the workshop.
the workshop is quite extensive and you will probably not be able to complete it completely tonight.

### Prerequisites

You can participate in this workshop using _NativeScript Playground_ or _NativeScript Sidekick_.

The [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org) is a browser-based environment for developing simple apps 
and does not require any additional software on your PC. It requires only two apps on your mobile device.

NativeScript Sidekick includes the [NativeScript CLI](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) and and allows 
you to create apps using your favorite IDE. 
If you want to build your apps on your machine, you need to set up each platform (iOS/Android) you intend to build for 
on your development machine. If you plan to use only the _Cloud Build_ functionality, the local installation for iOS or 
Android can be ignored.

[NativeScript Sidekick installation instructions](https://docs.nativescript.org/sidekick/intro/installation)

> **TIP**: If you run into issues completing the setup instructions, try 
[joining the NativeScript Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation) and asking questions 
in the #getting-started channel.

For ease of development NativeScript extensions are available for Visual Studio Code and the JetBrains IDEs 
like WebStorm and IntelliJ IDEA.

If you don't have an IDE installed, you could [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), 
and then [install the editor’s NativeScript extension](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/visual-studio-code-extension#installation).
