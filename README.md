* [Workshop Instructions](https://wvegteren.github.io/workshop-nativescript/docs)

## Issues?

Found a problem in [this workshop’s instructions](https://nativescript.github.io/wvegteren/workshop-nativescript/)? 
The instructions live in this repo’s `docs/chapters` folder. 
The `docs` folder is a Jekyll site, so you can run it locally with the following commands 
(assuming you have [Jekyll installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)):

```
cd docs
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Alternatively just send a pull request with any content changes.
